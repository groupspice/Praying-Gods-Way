        <text><![CDATA[READ ME FIRSTMost people want to live a healthy, balanced spiritual life, but few achieve this by themselves. And most small groups struggle to balance all of God’s purposes in their meetings. Groups tend to overemphasize one of the  ve purposes, perhaps fellowship or discipleship. Rarely is there a healthy balance that includes evangelism, ministry, and worship. That’s why we’ve included all of these elements in this study so you can live a healthy, balanced spiritual life over time.A typical group session will include the following:Memory VersesFor each session we have provided a memory verse that emphasizes an important truth from the session. This is an optional exercise, but we believe that memorizing Scripture can be a vital part of  ll- ing our minds with God’s Word. We encourage you to give this important habit a try.CONNECTING with God’s Family (Fellowship)The foundation for spiritual growth is an intimate connection withGod and his family. A few people who really know you and who earn7]]></text>

You can get to know your whole group by using the icebreaker ques- tion, and/or you can check in with one or two group members—your spiritual partner(s)—for a deeper connection and encouragement in your spiritual journey.DVD TEACHING SEGMENT. A Deepening Life Together: Pray- ing God’s Way Video Teaching DVD companion to this study guide is available. For each study session, the DVD contains a lesson taught by George McKinney. If you are using the DVD, you will view the teaching segment after your Connecting discussion and before your group discussion time (the Growing section). At the end of each session in this study guide you will  nd space for your notes on the teaching segment.GROWING to Be Like Christ (Discipleship)Here is where you come face-to-face with Scripture. In core passages you’ll explore what the Bible teaches about the topic of the study. The focus won’t be on accumulating information but on how we should live in light of the Word of God. We want to help you apply the Scriptures practically, creatively, and from your heart as well as your head. At the end of the day, allowing the timeless truths from God’s Word to transform our lives in Christ is our greatest aim.DEVELOPING Your Gifts to Serve Others (Ministry)Jesus trained his disciples to discover and develop their gifts to serve others. And God has designed each of us uniquely to serve him in a way no other person can. This section will help you discover and use your God-given design. It will also encourage your group to discover your unique design as a community. In this study, you’ll put into practice what you’ve learned in the Bible study by taking a step to serve others. These simple steps will take your group on a faith journey that could change your lives forever.8]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Read Me FirstSHARING Your Life Mission Every Day (Evangelism)Many people skip over this aspect of the Christian life because it’s scary, relationally awkward, or simply too much work for their busy schedules. But Jesus wanted all of his disciples to help outsiders con- nect with him, to know him personally. This doesn’t mean preaching on street corners. It could mean welcoming a few newcomers into your group, hosting a short-term group in your home, or walking through this study with a friend. In this study, you’ll have an op- portunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.SURRENDERING Your Life for God’s Pleasure (Worship)God is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will give you a chance to surrender your heart to God in prayer and worship. You may read a psalm together, share a page in your jour- nal, or sing a song to close your meeting. If you have never prayed aloud in a group before, no one will pressure you. Instead, you’ll experience the support of others who are praying for you.Study NotesThis section provides background notes on the Bible passage(s) you examine in the Growing section. You may want to refer to these notes during your group meeting or as a reference for those doing additional study.For Deeper Study (Optional)If you want to dig deeper into more Bible passages about the topic at hand, we’ve provided additional passages and questions. Your group may choose to do study homework ahead of each meeting in order to cover more biblical material. Or you as an individual may choose to study the For Deeper Study on your own. If you prefer not to do study homework, the Growing section will provide9]]></text>

These options allow individuals or the whole group to go deeper in their study, while still accommodating those who can’t do homework or are new to your group.You can record your discoveries in your journal. We encourage you to read some of your insights to a friend (spiritual partner) for accountability and support. Spiritual partners may check in each week over the phone, through e-mail, or at the beginning of the group meeting.Re ectionsOn the Re ections pages we provide Scriptures to read and re ect on between group meetings. We suggest you use this section to seek God at home throughout the week. This time at home should begin and end with prayer. Don’t get in a hurry; take enough time to hear God’s direction.Subgroup for Discussion and PrayerIf your group is large (more than seven people), we encourage you to separate into groups of two to four for discussion and prayer. This is to encourage greater participation and deeper discussion.10]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[INTRODUCTIONWelcome to the Deepening Life Together Bible study on Praying God’s Way. Our relationship with God is strengthened and our knowledge of him grows as we share our lives with him in prayer. Jesus made prayer the highest priority in his life, turning to God not only in times of crisis, but in times of decision, need, and joy and happiness as well. Jesus shared his whole life with God, not just the di cult or challenging parts.In this study we will learn to pray as Jesus prayed as we experience Scripture together. This journey will make known God’s purposes for our prayer lives. We will connect with our loving and faithful Father and with other believers in small group community. We will become his hands and feet here on earth as he reveals our uniqueness and his willingness to use us. And we will experience the closeness that he desires with us as we prayerfully respond to him and learn to place him  rst in our lives.We at Baker Books and Lifetogether Publishing look forward to hearing the stories of how God changes you from the inside out during this small group experience. We pray God blesses you with all he has planned for you through this journey together.For the Lord is good and his love endures forever; his faithfulness continues through all generations.Psalm 100:5 (NIV)11]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[SESSION ONETHE PRIORITY OF PRAYERSTAYING CONNECTED 24/7Memory Verse: Before daybreak the next morning, Jesus got up and went out to an isolated place to pray (Mark 1:35 NLT).In this digital age, the term “staying connected” conjures up im- ages of cell phones, text messaging, e-mail, e-greetings, blogs, and Facebook—to name a few. We communicate with our families, co- workers, classmates, and loved ones, both near and far away, with handheld devices or computers, without even the need to pick up a telephone.One would think with all the technology, we would have more free time; but realistically, we have less. Our days are so full that we still fail to keep in touch with people we care about, much less the One who deserves our attention the most—our heavenly Father.We can learn much from the fact that, despite an impossibly busy schedule, Jesus made time to be quiet and alone with God, his Father. He knew that above all else, he needed to keep connected to his source of strength and guidance. We all need this connec- tion as well. Thankfully, Jesus invites us to partner with him and discover the joy of staying connected to him 24 hours a day, seven days a week.13]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Praying God’s WayConnectingOpen your group with prayer. Ask the Lord to unify your group and challenge you as you study about prayer through this study.Take time to pass around a copy of the Small Group Roster, a sheet of paper, or one of you pass your study guide, opened to the Small Group Roster. Each of you write down your contact informa- tion including the best time and method for contacting you. Then, someone volunteer to make copies or type up a list with everyone’s information and e-mail it to the group this week.1. Begin this  rst session of Praying God’s Way by introducing yourselves. Include your name, what you do for a living, and what you do for fun. You may also include whether or not you are married, how long you have been married, how many children you have, and their ages.2. Whether your group is new or ongoing, it’s always important to re ect on and review your group values together. In the Ap- pendix is a Small Group Agreement with the values we’ve found most useful in sustaining healthy, balanced groups. Choose two or three values that you have room to grow in, or haven’t previously focused on, to emphasize during this study. Doing this will take your group to the next stage of intimacy and spiritual health.3. Share your expectations for this study on prayer. How do you hope God will challenge you?GrowingJesus made prayer the highest priority in his life. Many times in the Bible we see Jesus setting aside time to be alone with God despite a hectic schedule. We will discuss how Jesus handled his busyness, what kinds of things he prayed about, and why.14]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Priority of Prayer4. Read Mark 1:14–34. Jesus had a very busy ministry. What kinds of things occupied his time?How are these things like or unlike the things that occupy your daily life?5. Mark 1:35 shows us that, as busy as he was, Jesus took time to pray to his heavenly Father. Read Mark 1:35 aloud. Where did Jesus go to pray?What do you think is the signi cance of where Jesus prayed?6. Read Mark 1:36–39. What do you think was the connection between Jesus’s decision to make time for prayer and the way he dealt with people’s expectations?7. Jesus’s busy schedule wasn’t about to change anytime soon. How do you respond to this statement: “If we are too busy to pray, we are too busy”?8. What are some of the things that sometimes hinder you from prayer?9. Look up the following passages and note how prayer  t into Jesus’s life and ministry at various points. For instance, what did he pray about? What happened when he prayed?t Luke 3:21–22t Luke 9:28–31t Luke 6:12–13t Luke 22:41–44; 23:4610. How would you summarize the role prayer played in Jesus’s life?11. Do you think Jesus was unique in his need for consistent times of prayer? Explain.15]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Praying God’s Way12. What will it take for you to build consistent times of prayer into your life?How motivated are you to do this? Why is that?Jesus made prayer the highest priority in his life, knowing that he could only accomplish his mission through complete dependence on the Father. It is so with us as well. Prayer is the primary means by which we stay connected to the Father, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. And apart from that connection, we can do nothing (John 15:5).DevelopingGod has designed each of us uniquely with individual talents, abili- ties, passions, and experiences that determine where we serve within the body of Christ. Before we begin this journey of discovering how God made us, it’s important to be sure that we live consis- tently and honestly. One way we can do this is through spiritual accountability.13. We strongly recommend each of you partner with someone in the group to help you in your spiritual journey during this study. This person will be your “spiritual partner” for the next several weeks. Pair up with someone in your group now (men partner with men and women with women) and turn to the Personal Health Plan.In the box that says, “WHO are you connecting with spiritu- ally?” write your partner’s name. In the box that says, “WHAT is your next step for growth?” write one step you would like to take for growth during this study. Tell your partner what step you chose. When you check in with your partner each meeting, the “Partner’s Progress” column on this chart will provide a place to record your partner’s progress in the goal he or she chose.16]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Priority of PrayerSharingBelievers are called to strengthen and encourage one another as we live out our faith each day: “And let us consider how we may spur one another on toward love and good deeds. Let us not give up meeting together, as some are in the habit of doing, but let us encourage one another—and all the more as you see the Day approaching (Heb. 10:24–25 NIV). This should include reaching out to believers around us who are not connected in a Christian community.14. Use the Circles of Life diagram below to help you think of people you come in contact with on a regular basis who need to be connected in Christian community. Try to write two names in each circle. Consider the following ideas for reaching out to one or two of the people you list and make a plan to follow through with them this week.Family(immediate or extended)Acquaintances(neighbors, kids’ sports teams, school, and so forth)Fun(gym, hobbies, hangouts)FriendsCo-workers(workplace)17]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Praying God’s Wayt This is a wonderful time to welcome a few friends into your group. Which of the people on your list could you invite? It’s possible that you may need to help your friend overcome obstacles to coming to a place where he or she can encounter Jesus. Does your friend need a ride to the group or help with child care? How can you help?t Consider inviting a friend to attend a weekend church ser- vice with you and possibly plan to enjoy a meal together afterward. This can be a great opportunity to talk with someone about your faith in Jesus.t Is there someone who is unable to attend your group but who still needs a connection? Would you be willing to have lunch or co ee with that person, catch up on life, and share something you’ve learned from this study? Jesus doesn’t call all of us to lead small groups, but he does call every disciple to spiritually multiply his or her life over time.SurrenderingEvery session we will make it our priority to surrender our hearts in worship to God and to pray for one another.15. Allow everyone to answer this question: “How can we pray for you this week?” Share your prayer requests in your group and ask everyone to write down the personal requests of each member on the Prayer and Praise Report. Commit to praying for your group throughout the week.16. Take a few minutes to talk about what it would take to make time with God a priority every day or even  ve or six days a week. Don’t demand an hour or even a half-hour of time at  rst; consider drawing near to God for a few minutes each day and gradually you will desire more. At the end of each session, you’ll  nd Re ections pages. These include  ve daily Scripture readings with room to record your thoughts and space to summarize what God has taught you through the session18]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[The Priority of Prayeron day six. These will o er reinforcement of the principles we are learning and help to develop the habit of time alone with God.Study NotesHoly Spirit: The third Person in the Trinity. The Holy Spirit is a person distinct from the Father and the Son, though united to both in the oneness of the Godhead. In Scripture, the Holy Spirit is dis- tinctly called God, and names are given to him that belong only to God (see Acts 5:3–4 and 28:25–27, Heb. 10:15–17, and 2 Cor. 3:17–18). Scripture also assigns divine attributes, such as knowledge, sovereignty, and eternity to the Holy Spirit (see 1 Cor. 2:11; 12:11 and Heb. 9:14). Additionally, divine works, such as creation and the new birth, are attributed to the Holy Spirit in Genesis 1:2; Job 26:13, and John 3:3–8, and homage appropriate only to God is given to the Holy Spirit in Acts 28:25–27 and 2 Corinthians 13:14.Trans guration: Means to “change into another form.” The trans-  guration of Jesus is recorded in Matthew 17:2 and Mark 9:2. In these accounts, Jesus “was trans gured” before his disciples Peter, James, and John. Jesus’s external appearance was changed, his face gleaming like the sun, and his clothing being so white that it shone like light. The Trans guration represents Jesus’s glory at the right hand of God (Acts 2:33) and the glory he will have at his second coming to establish his Kingdom: the Son of Man coming in his kingdom (see Matt. 16:28 and 2 Peter 1:16–18). The trans guration encouraged the disciples in the expectation of the messianic king- dom promised to Israel as the preaching of the kingdom was fast approaching its end and culmination in the rejection and imminent death of the King.19]]></text>

Read this prayer. What speci c things did Jesus pray for:• himself (vv. 1–5)• his disciples (vv. 6–19)• future believers (we are included in this) (vv. 20–26)1. What does this prayer teach us about what a believer’s prayer life should look like?2. Read Hebrews 7:25. What does Jesus live to do for us? 3. What does that say about the value of prayer?ReflectionsEach day, read the daily verses and give prayerful consideration to what you learn about God, his Spirit, and his place in your life. Then record your thoughts, insights, or prayer in the Re ect section below the verses you read. On the sixth day record a summary of what you have learned through the session.Day 1.

A “get to know you” co ee, dinner, or dessert is a great way to launch a new study. You may want to review the Small Group Agreement and share the names of a few friends you can invite to join you. But most importantly, have fun before your study time begins.Where do we  nd new members for our group?This can be challenging, especially for new groups that have only a fewpeopleorforexistinggroupsthatloseafewpeoplealongtheway. We encourage you to pray with your group and then brainstorm a list of people from work, church, your neighborhood, your children’s school, family, the gym, and so forth. Then have each group member invite several of the people on his or her list. Another good strategy is to ask church leaders to make an announcement that your group is open to new members.No matter how you  nd members, it’s vital that you stay on the lookout for new people to join your group. All groups tend to go through healthy attrition—the result of moves, releasing new lead- ers, ministry opportunities, and so forth—and if the group gets too45]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked Questionssmall, it could be at risk of shutting down. If you and your group stay open, you’ll be amazed at the people God sends your way. The next person just might become a friend for life. You never know!How long will this group meet?It’s totally up to the group—once you come to the end of this study. Most groups meet weekly for at least their  rst six months together, but every other week can work as well. We strongly recommend that the group meet for the  rst six months on a weekly basis if at all possible. This allows for continuity, and if people miss a meeting they aren’t gone for a whole month.At the end of this study, each group member may decide whether heorshewantstocontinueonforanotherstudy.Somegroupslaunch relationships that last for years, and others are stepping-stones into another group experience. Either way, enjoy the journey.What if this group is not working for me?Personality con icts, life stage di erences, geographical distance, level of spiritual maturity, or any number of things can cause you to feel the group doesn’t work for you. Relax. Pray for God’s direction, and at the end of this study decide whether to continue with this group or  nd another. You don’t buy the  rst car you look at or marry the  rst person you date, and the same goes with a group. Don’t bail out before the study is  nished—God might have something to teach you. Also, don’t run from con ict or prejudge people before you have given them a chance. God is still working in you too!Who is the leader?Most groups have an o cial leader. But ideally, the group will ma- ture and members will share the facilitation of meetings. We have discovered that healthy groups share hosting and leading of the group. This model ensures that all members grow, give their unique contribution, and develop their gifts. This study guide and the Holy Spirit can keep things on track even when you share leadership. Christ has promised to be in your midst as you gather. Ultimately, God is your leader each step of the way.46]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Frequently Asked QuestionsHow do we handle the child care needs in our group?This can be a sensitive issue. We suggest that you empower the group to openly brainstorm solutions. You may try one option that works for a while and then adjust over time. Our favorite approach is for adults to meet in the living room or dining room, and share the cost of a babysitter (or two) who can be with the kids in a di erent part of the house. In this way, parents don’t have to be away from their children all evening when their children are too young to be left at home. A second option is to use one home for the kids and a second home (close by) for the adults. A third idea is to rotate the responsi- bility of providing a lesson or care for the children either in the same home or in another home nearby. This can be an incredible blessing for kids. Finally, the most common idea is to decide that you need to have a night to invest in your spiritual lives individually or as a couple, and make your own arrangements for child care. No mat- ter what decision the group makes, the best approach is to dialogue openly about both the problem and the solution.47]]></text>

Remember who is in control; the time to worry is when you’re not worried. Those who are soft in heart (and sweaty-palmed) are those whom God is sure to speak through.Seek support. Ask your leader, coleader, or close friend to pray for you and prepare with you before the session. Walking through the study will help you anticipate potentially di cult questions and discussion topics.Bring your uniqueness to the study. Lean into who you are and how God wants you to uniquely lead the study.Prepare. Prepare. Prepare. Go through the session several times. If you are using the DVD, listen to the teaching segment and Leader Lifter. Consider writing in a journal or fasting for a day to prepare yourself for what God wants to do.Don’t wait until the last minute to prepare.Ask for feedback so you can grow. Perhaps in an e-mail or on cards handed out at the study, have everyone write down three things you did well and one thing you could improve on. Don’t get defensive, but show an openness to learn and grow.81]]></text>

Not all Christians are called to be leaders or teachers, but we are all called to be “shepherds” of a few someday.Share with your group what God is doing in your heart. God is searching for those whose hearts are fully his. Share your trials and victories. We promise that people will relate.Prayerfully consider whom you would like to pass the baton to next week.

        <text><![CDATA[Session One The Priority of PrayerConnecting1. We’ve designed this study for both new and established groups, and for both seekers and the spiritually mature. New groups need to invest more time building relationships with each other. Established groups often want to dig deeper into Bible study and application. Whether your group is new or has been together for a while, be sure to introduce yourselves to new people.2. A very important item in this  rst session is the Small Group Agreement. An agreement helps clarify your group’s priorities and cast new vision for what the group can become. You can  nd this in the Appendix of this study guide. We’ve found that groups that talk about these values up front and commit to an agreement bene t signi cantly. They work through con-  icts long before people get to the point of frustration, so there’s a lot less pain.Take some time to review this agreement before your meeting. Then during your meeting, read the agreement aloud to the entire group. If some people have concerns about a speci c item or the agreement as a whole, be sensitive to their concerns. Explain that tens of thousands of groups use agreements like this one as a simple tool for building trust and group health over time.As part of this discussion, we recommend talking about shared owner- ship of the group. It’s important that each member have a role. See the Appendix to learn more about Team Roles. This is a great tool to get this important practice launched in your group.Also, you will  nd a Small Group Calendar in the Appendix for use in planning your group meetings and roles. Take a look at the calendar prior87LEADER’S NOTESSESSIONS]]></text>

It’s a good idea to ask ahead of time, because not everyone is comfortable reading aloud in public.4. Jesus was a man of action, whose ministry was a whirlwind of teaching, healing, casting out demons, and proclaiming the kingdom of God.5. Jesus had just had a successful ministry in Capernaum healing many sick and demon-possessed people. Early the next day, Jesus went out by himself for a time of prayer. By the time the disciples found him, he was ready to face the day. We must follow Christ’s example by making time for personal prayer. Those who help and serve on Sunday especially need to set aside time with God to restore their strength. Our ability to serve will be hindered if we neglect times of spiritual replenishment. During his ministry on earth, Jesus was in constant prayer with the Father. Mark recorded three of these times (see Mark 6:46 and 14:32–42).9. Jesus prayed at key transitions and crisis points in his life. For example, here he prayed as the Holy Spirit descended on him after his baptism. He also prayed in the Garden of Gethsemane (Luke 22:41–44) and even on the cross (Luke 23:46).It’s important to examine what speci c things Jesus prayed about so we can do the same. First, Jesus prayed before making decisions such as in the case of choosing his twelve disciples. This should serve an example to us that we, like Jesus, need the strength and wisdom of the Father in our lives.In Luke 22:41–44, Jesus prayed before going to the cross. In the garden Jesus’s prayer was agonizing. Yet, his prayer brought clarity to his situation. In Luke 23:46, Jesus gave up his spirit and died.DevelopingThis section enables you to help the group see the importance of devel- oping our abilities for service to God.13. For many, spiritual partners will be a new idea. We highly encourage you to try pairs for this study. It’s so hard to start a spiritual practice like prayer or consistent Bible reading with no support. A friend makes a huge di erence. As leader, you may want to prayerfully decide who would be a good match with whom. Remind people that this partnership isn’t forever; it’s just for a few weeks. Be sure to have extra copies of the Personal Health Plan available88]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s Notesat this meeting in case you need to have a group of three spiritual partners. It is a good idea for you to look over the Personal Health Plan before the meeting so you can help people understand how to use it.Instruct your group members to enlist a spiritual partner by asking them to pair up with someone in the group (we suggest that men partner with men and women with women) and turn to the Personal Health Plan.Ask the group to complete the instructions in the session for the WHO and WHAT questions on the Personal Health Plan. Your group has now begun to address two of God’s purposes for their lives!You can see that the Personal Health Plan contains space to record the ups and downs and progress over time in the column labeled “My Prog- ress.” When partners check in each meeting they can record their partner’s progress in the goal he or she chose in the “Partner’s Progress” column on this chart. In the Appendix you’ll  nd a Sample Personal Health Plan  lled in as an example.The WHERE, WHEN, and HOW questions on the Personal Health Plan will be addressed in future sessions of the study.SharingJesus wants all of his disciples to help outsiders connect with him, to know him personally. This section should provide an opportunity to go beyond Bible study to biblical living.14. We provided a Circles of Life diagram for you and the group to use to help you identify people who need to be connected in Christian community. When people are asked why they never go to church they often say, “No one ever invited me.” Remind the group that our responsibility is to invite people, but we are not responsible for how they respond. Talk to the group about the importance of inviting people; remind them that healthy small groups make a habit of inviting friends, neighbors, unconnected church members, co-workers, etc., to join their groups or join them at a weekend service. When people get connected to a group of new friends they often join the church.The Circles of Life represent one of the values of the Small Group Agree- ment “Welcome for Newcomers.” Some groups fear that newcomers will interrupt the intimacy that members have built over time. However, groups generally gain strength with the infusion of new blood. It’s like a river of living water  owing into a stagnant pond. Some groups remain permanently open, while others open periodically, such as at the beginning and ending of a study. Love grows by giving itself away. If your circle becomes too large for easy face-to-face conversations, you can simply form a second discussion circle in another room in your home.89]]></text>

        <text><![CDATA[Leader’s NotesSurrenderingGod is most pleased by a heart that is fully his. Each group session will provide group members a chance to surrender their hearts to God in prayer and worship. Group prayer requests and prayer time should be included every meeting.16. As you move to the time of sharing your prayer requests, be sure to remind the group of the importance of con dentiality and keeping what is shared in the group within the group. Everyone must feel that things will not go beyond the group if you are to have safety and bonding in the group.Use the Prayer and Praise Report in the Appendix to record your prayer requests. There you can keep track of requests and celebrate answers to prayer.17. This question is meant to encourage quiet time at home each day throughout the week. Here you can help the group see the importance of making time with God a priority. Read through this section and be prepared to help the group understand how important it is to  ll our minds with the Word of God. If people already have a good Bible reading plan and commitment, that is great, but you may have people who struggle to stay in the Word daily. Sometimes beginning with a simple commitment to a short daily reading can start a habit that changes their life. The Re ections pages at the end of each session include verses that were either talked about in the session or support the teaching of the session. They are very short readings with a few lines to encourage people to write down their thoughts. Remind the group about these Re ections each session after the Surrendering section.For Deeper StudyWe have included an optional For Deeper Study section in each ses- sion. For Deeper Study provides additional passages for individual study on the topic of each session. If your group likes to do deeper Bible study, consider having members study the For Deeper Study passages at home between meetings.Session Two The Pattern of PrayerConnecting2. Turn to your Personal Health Plan. Share with your partner how your time with God went since the last meeting. What is one thing you discovered? Did you make a commitment to a next step that you can share? Make a note about your partner’s progress and how you can pray for him or her.90]]></text>
